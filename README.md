# [Optimizing Bi-Encoder for Named Entity Recognition via Contrastive Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9EAQVEINuum)

## Introduction
This is the repository for BINDER ([**BI**-encoder for **N**ame**D** **E**ntity **R**ecognition via Contrastive Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9EAQVEINuum)) accepted at ICLR 2023.

BINDER employs two encoders to separately map text and entity types
into the same vector space, and reuses the vector representations of entity types for different text spans (or vice versa), resulting in a faster training and inference speed.
Based on the bi-encoder representations, BINDER introduces a unified contrastive learning framework for NER, which encourages the representation of entity types to be similar with the corresponding
entity mentions, and to be dissimilar with non-entity text spans.
BINDER also introduces a novel dynamic thresholding loss in contrastive learning. At test time, it leverages candidate-specific dynamic thresholds to distinguish entity spans from non-entity ones.
Check out [our paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9EAQVEINuum) for the details.

## Quick Start
### 1. Data Preparation

Follow the instructions [README.md](data_preproc/README.md) in the data_preproc folder.


### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n binder -y python=3.9
conda activate binder
conda install pytorch==1.13 pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install transformers==4.24.0 datasets==2.6.1 wandb==0.13.5 seqeval==1.2.2
```

### 3. Experiment Run
Assuming you have prepared data for ACE2005 and finished environment setup, below is the command to run an experiment on ACE2005:
```bash
python run_ner.py conf/ace05.json
```

To run experiments on other datasets, simply change the config.
